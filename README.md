# Javascript Physics Engine - Because why not?

It is August 6th, 2020. The world is on fire and DEFCON 28 safe-mode is here. Yes DEFCON really was canceled, or at least it moved online for the first time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. That means I am working from home this year and I wanted to build a project that would accomplish two things:
1. Make me better at javascript
2. Utilize my obsessive love of physics

What better way to do that than writing my own physics engine in JS? This project will be based on the work of daniel shiffman and his "nature of code series" as a framework for me to build out the engine, but the code here is entirely my own and his original series was done in Processing not javascript. I will be using the p5.js library to make my life easier. Enjoy!
